# EBFields Simulation

## Name
The name stands for Electricity and Magnetic Fields simulation.

## Description

This is a graphics-based interactive simulation software that allows the user to simulate point charges in the effects of electric and/or magnetic fields. The software will draw the different directions for velocity, electric fields, magnetic fields, electric force, and magnetic force for each point charge. The user will be able to add, remove, or move the different electric fields, magnetic fields, and point charges.

## Installation and Usage
