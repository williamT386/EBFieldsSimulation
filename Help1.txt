This project simulates point charges, uniform electric 
fields, and uniform magnetic fields. You can have multiple 
of each. 

Any arrows in the diagram are drawn to match the color key 
on the right.

Each electric field and magnetic field will have a specific 
direction, since it is a vector, and that direction is 
drawn as an arrow of the specified color in the Color Key.

To create a point charge, electric field, or magnetic 
field, drag its option from the right side of the screen 
onto the drawing canvas in the middle. Point charges will 
be created where it is dropped. If you drag a point charge 
into an illegal spot (off the screen or on the right side 
with the buttons or collides with another point charge), 
it will not be created. 

If you drag and drop an electric field or magnetic field, 
it will then ask you for a direction for that field. You 
can only enter U (up), D (down), L (left), R (right), 
I (letter i for in), O (out). Look at the compass on the 
bottom right for reference.
