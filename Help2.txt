After placing a point charge, you can drag it to a new 
location. Fields cannot be changed after placement. You 
can clear the screen with the Reset button.

You can adjust information about a point charge already 
placed by clicking on it. For x and y, you can only enter 
integer values. For charge, you can only enter + or -. 
For velocity direction, you can only enter U (up), 
D (down), L (left), R (right), I (letter i for in), O (out).

Point charges create a non-uniform electric field around 
themselves, which create electric forces on other point 
charges. To simulate this, click ‘Include electric fields 
by point charges’ button on the right. This draws 
electric force arrows caused by electric fields of point 
charges as purple. The arrows for these are just lines, 
not actual arrows, for simplicity.

There are 3 shortcut keys. Control-P pauses/unpauses the 
simulation, so if you are currently dragging something, 
you can pause the simulation to access your cursor without
moving the dragged element. Control-Q exits the app. 
Clicking the exit button visually may not exit the app, 
but you can force quit the app.
