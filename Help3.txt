This program is written by William Tang (Monta Vista High 
School, Class of 2022). His github account is williamT386.

This program uses an altered version of 
cmu_112_graphics.py version 0.9.0 written by Carnegie 
Mellon University for 15-112-s21.

This program is written as a gift for Mr. Birdsong from
Monta Vista High School, whose AP Physics C course
William took from 2020-2021. Hopefully, this program
will have gained much more users since then.

If you wish to contribute to this program, as of 8/12/2021,

Please do not directly commit to the main branch; instead,
